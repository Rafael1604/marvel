            <h2>ABOUT MARVEL</h2>
            <p>
                Marvel Comics is a comic book publisher based in New York City. It has been a property of The Walt Disney Company since December 31, 2009, and became a subsidiary of Disney Publishing Worldwide in March 2023.<br><br>
                Founded in 1939 by Martin Goodman as Timely Comics, it was generally known as Atlas Comics by 1951. The Marvel era began in August 1961 with the launch of <em>The Fantastic Four</em>, alongside other superhero titles created by Stan Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, and many others. Over the years, the Marvel brand has been solidified as the companyâ€™s primary identity.<br><br>
                Marvel features a vast array of well-known superheroes, including <b>Spider-Man, Iron Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Black Widow, Thor, Hulk, Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Deadpool</b>. The publisher is also home to popular superhero teams like the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy.<br><br>
                In addition to its heroes, Marvel boasts an impressive lineup of supervillains, such as <b>Doctor Doom, Magneto, Green Goblin, Kingpin, Red Skull, Loki, Ultron, Thanos, Kang the Conqueror, Venom, and Galactus</b>. Most of Marvel's fictional characters inhabit a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with many locations reflecting real-life places; notably, a significant number of major characters are based in New York City.<br><br>
                Furthermore, Marvel has published several licensed properties from other companies, including <em>Star Wars</em> comics, which were published twice from 1977 to 1987 and again since 2015.            </p>

                    <p>1. Protege<br>Protege asserts itself as the number one most powerful cosmic character in the Marvel<br>
                        Universe by raw potential alone. It is a child-like god and possesses the ability to mimic any<br>
                         other entity in existence. Even the One-Above-All and the Living Tribunal.
